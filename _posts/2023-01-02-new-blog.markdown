Itâ€™s been quite a bit of time since I last wrote a blog post, about 5 years give or take a few months. 
To be honest, that feels like a lifetime ago. I am going to restart writing posts, in large part because 
I think it pushes me intellectually in ways that are hard to replicate in academic or work setting. I 
will have more up soon.
